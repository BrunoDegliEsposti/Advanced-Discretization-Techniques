I've done both the mandatory exercise (15pts) and the bonus exercise (5+2).

The solutions to the elliptic problem in main.m are converging to 0 instead of u_ex,
and I don't really know why... There must be a silly mistake somewhere in the code,
but I just couldn't find it before Tuesday.

By the way, I did not succed in loading the sample meshes with the load() command.
Maybe the problem is that I use MATLAB R2018b and the .dat files were generated by Octave?
